## Added: Player stats & matches pages

- `/` shows a sample squad with Sorare-like player cards.
- Clicking a card goes to `/players/:id` with statistics & history.
- `/matches` lists matches; `/matches/:id` shows events, lineups, and a match report.

All data is dummy and lives in `src/data/dummy.js`.
